# Pong-Game
This repository project implements a version of the classic Pong game. This project is for the 3rd year Introduction to Robotics course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Bucharest.

## Backstory
This project was born out of a desire to recreate the classic Pong game using an Arduino and a few basic components. Inspired by the simplicity of retro gaming, I wanted to demonstrate how creatively a microcontroller can be used.  
Every line of code and component has been thought to bring a nostalgic experience to life, combining passion for hardware and software in an accessible and fun way.

## How to play
The game is very simple and intuitive to play: the game is usually played by 2 people, but in this project I will implement that the game can be played by one person as well.  
The game will be played on the 8x8 LED matrix in which 2 paddles will appear that will measure 2 hoops in height and one hoop in width and a ball of one square length and width.  

Objective: 
  - Use the paddles to return the ball to the opponent.
  - Move the paddle with the joystick to catch the ball when it returns to you
  - Be careful that the ball does not pass the paddle because the game will end

If the difficulty of the game is set to easy, which means that the ball moves quite slowly and the paddles faster so that the players can catch the ball. The higher the difficulty, the faster the ball will move and the slower the paddles
