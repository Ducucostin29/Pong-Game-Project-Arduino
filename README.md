# Pong-Game
This repository project implements a version of the classic Pong game. This project is for the 3rd year Introduction to Robotics course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Bucharest.

#Backstory
This project was born out of a desire to recreate the classic Pong game using an Arduino and a few basic components. Inspired by the simplicity of retro gaming, I wanted to demonstrate how creatively a microcontroller can be used.
Every line of code and component has been thought to bring a nostalgic experience to life, combining passion for hardware and software in an accessible and fun way.
